            It's always around me, all this noise, but
            Not nearly as loud as the voice saying
            "Let it happen, let it happen"
            (It's gonna feel so good)
            "Just let it happen, let it happen"
            
            All this running around
            Tryin' to cover my shadow
            A notion growing inside
            Now all the others seem shallow
            
            All this running around
            Bearing down on my shoulders
            I can hear an alarm
            It must be morning
            
            I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
            It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound, and
            When it happens, when it happens
            (I won't be holding on)
            So let it happen, let it happen
            
            All this running around
            I can't fight it much longer
            Something's tryin' to get out
            And it's never been closer
            
            If my take-off fails
            Make up some other story
            But if I never come back
            Tell my mother I'm sorry
            
            Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
            Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
            Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
            Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
            
            Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
            Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
            Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
            Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
